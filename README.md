# coffee-bean-database

Welcome to the Coffee Bean Database! Keep track of your favorite (or least favorite) coffee beans in one place! As someone who enjoys brewing and drinking coffee, I want to aggregate my personal experience with different kinds of coffee to document and share. I couldn't find a simple interface to do that so I created my own!

## Features

- Add new beans with select attributes (location, roast, tasting notes)
- Rate beans on your list from 1 to 5 stars
- View your list of beans in a filtered list

## Installation

Make sure you have [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) installed
Fork and clone this repository, navigate to the directory that contains this program in your terminal then run:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

Open index.html in your browser and you're good to go!
